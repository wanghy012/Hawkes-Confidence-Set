For an example see main.m

run.m simulates a series of events given parameter A and mu

MLE_nonnegative.m solves the MLE given event data

polyhedral.m gives the first-order approximated CI on each parameter

polyhedral2.m gives the first-order approximated CI with scaled z so that the stats donâ€™t explode for small intensity lambda.
